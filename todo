## latebit tracker

### SFX Editor
Creating sound effects is usually different than creating a track.

You usually don't care about notes but more about "motion" (a sound going
up is "happier" than a sound going down). We may want to provide an editor
that accommodates for that case better (for example, Tune is a single track
which can be controlled with a few vertical range inputs to draw a curve for
the sound).

### Write parsing errors to the "Output" of vscode

We could use the Output/Problems panel to surface errors instead of asking users
to open the console.

## latebit sprite editor

- [] extract library from engine code
- [] preview sprite animation
- [] select a frame to edit
- [] pick color and add a square
- [] eraser
- [] save

## latebit game previwer

- [] launch game
- [] debug game
- [] (whenever we support more than one scene) run from scene

### Random considerations

#### Logs
We need to give users a way to see logs in real time while they run the
game from the IDE. We could stream the log file pointed by latebit.cfg

#### Build and run
We can use a task provider: user defines the build task and we run it.

Can we reuse anything from CMake integration? Can we make assumptions on the debuggers? Do they _maybe_ have a common interface?

#### Ideal user experience

I hit my "run" shortcut and the game compiles and runs contextually.
I hit my "debug" shortcut, and the same happens - but I can step through things
in the code
